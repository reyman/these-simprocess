@ARTICLE{Langton1984,
  ABSTRACT      = {Self-reproduction in cellular automata is discussed with reference to the models of von Neumann and Codd. The conclusion is drawn that although the capacity for universal construction is a sufficient condition for self-reproduction, it is not a necessary condition. Slightly more “liberal” criteria for what constitutes genuine self-reproduction are introduced, and a simple self-reproducing structure is exhibited which satisfies these new criteria. This structure achieves its simplicity by storing its description in a dynamic “loop”, rather than on a static “tape”.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Foundational controversies in artificial life and artificial intelligence arise from lack of decidable criteria for defining the epistemic cuts that separate knowledge of reality from reality itself, e.g., description from construction, simulation from realization, mind from brain. Selective evolution began with a description-construction cut, i.e., the genetically coded synthesis of proteins. The highly evolved cognitive epistemology of physics requires an epistemic cut between reversible dynamic laws and the irreversible process of measuring initial conditions. This is also known as the measurement problem. Good physics can be done without addressing this epistemic problem, but not good biology and artificial life, because open-ended evolution requires the physical implementation of genetic descriptions. The course of evolution depends on the speed and reliability of this implementation, or how efficiently the real or artificial physical dynamics can be harnessed by nondynamic genetic symbols.},

  ABSTRACT = {L’approche complexe fait suite à l’approche Cartésienne, en considérant à la fois le tout, les parties et leurs relations. L’outil informatique s’avère de plus en plus indispensable du fait qu’il est soit impossible de recourir à une autre méthode d’investigation sur les systèmes complexes étudiés, soit qu’un autre choix est trop contraignant. La simulation informatique permet de mettre en œuvre virtuellement les modèles explicatifs construits quitte à vérifier à posteriori leur validité sur des données empiriques. Du fait de la richesse de l’approche complexe, les simulateurs à construire sont sophistiqués et non neutres. Ainsi, la collaboration pluridisciplinaire entre thématiciens et informaticiens est un des premiers défis à relever. Dans cette thèse nous proposons de matérialiser le processus de construction d’un projet de recherche impliquant plusieurs disciplines à l’aide du paradigme agent. Le paradigme agent a l’avantage d’être largement diffusé du fait de sa facilité d’accès et des analogies immédiates avec les objets d’étude que le paradigme suscite. Nous mettons en avant comment s’opère un changement de perspective qui implique tous les acteurs du projet. Il est réalisé une transformation de modélisation qui},

  ABSTRACT  = {I discuss the difference between models, simulalions, and experiments from an epistemological and an ontological perspective. I first distinguish between "static" models (like a map) and "dynamic" models endowed with the capacity to generate processes. Only the latter can be used to simulate. I then criticise the view according to which the difference between models/simulations and experiments 'is fundamentally epistemic in character. Following Herbert Slmon, I argue that the difference is ontological. Simulations merely require the existence of an abstract correspondence between the simulating and the simulated system. In experiments, in contrast, the causal relations governing the experimental and the target systems are grounded in the same material. Simulations can produce new knowledge just as experiments do, but the prior knowledge needed to run a good simulation is not the same as that needed to run a good experiment. I conclude by discussing "hybrid" cases of "experi- mental simulations" or "simulating experiments".},

  ABSTRACT      = {The Actor model is a mathematical theory that treats "Actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent digital computation. The model has been used both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as the theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent systems. Unlike previous models of computation, the Actor model was inspired by physical laws. It was also influenced by the programming languages Lisp, Simula 67 and Smalltalk-72, as well as ideas for Petri Nets, capability-based systems and packet switching. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud computing and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the Actor model. Actor technology will see significant application for integrating all kinds of digital information for individuals, groups, and organizations so their information usefully links together. Information integration needs to make use of the following information system principles: * Persistence. Information is collected and indexed. * Concurrency: Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in time. * Quasi-commutativity: Information can be used regardless of whether it initiates new work or become relevant to ongoing work. * Sponsorship: Sponsors provide resources for computation, i.e., processing, storage, and communications. * Pluralism: Information is heterogeneous, overlapping and often inconsistent. * Provenance: The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded The Actor Model is intended to provide a foundation for inconsistency robust information integration},

Ces agents peuvent être dotés de capacités plus ou moins développées, allant des agents réactifs constitutifs de l'intelligence collective aux agents cognitifs dotés de formes de rationalité plus sophistiquées. Modélisation et simulation multi-agents est illustré par des exemples d'utilisation et propose des ouvertures sur les développements récents dans ce domaine},

@ARTICLE{McMullin2004,
  ABSTRACT = {Computational autopoiesis--the realization of autopoietic entities in computational media--holds an important and distinctive role within the field of artificial life. Its earliest formulation by Francisco Varela, Humberto Maturana, and Ricardo Uribe was seminal in demonstrating the use of an artificial, computational medium to explore the most basic question of the abstract nature of living systems--over a decade in advance of the first Santa Fe Workshop on Artificial Life. The research program it originated has generated substantive demonstrations of progressively richer, lifelike phenomena. It has also sharply illuminated both conceptual and methodological problems in the field. This article provides an integrative overview of the sometimes disparate work in this area, and argues that computational autopoiesis continues to provide an effective framework for addressing key open problems in artificial life.},

@ARTICLE{Ridley1966,
  ABSTRACT = {Abstract This Monte Carlo model for simulating the reproductive history of a cohort of women is described in detail. The model provides for patterns of survival, sterility, formation and dissolution of sexual unions, fecundability, lactation, foetal wastage, family planning practices etc. Natality indices specific for marital status, for duration of marriage and for age, as well as analyses of birth spacing patterns are among the results that may be obtained. In the model, the experimental unit is an individual woman. The complete life history of a woman is generated and recorded before the history of the next woman is generated. The data for the whole cohort are analyzed at the end of the programme. The model includes two kinds of states into which a woman may pass, namely: (1) permanent changes of status such as death, sterility, or becoming a family planner, and (2) temporary states, each with a probability distribution of length of stay. The probabilities of the various events or changes of state may vary from age, parity, and other features of a woman's status or history. Natural fecundability at any age may also vary from woman to woman. In this programme natality patterns and specific indices such as age-specific fertility rates are produced, in a quasi-realistic fashion, by the interplay of the demographic and biological parameters postulated for any cohort. Consequently, the effect of changes in anyone factor can be studied, as well as the interaction resulting from changes in several factors. The purposes and potentials of the model are both substantive and methodological. As an illustration, a series of computer runs attempting to simulate the reproductive patterns of Indian women is presented. These results, as well as some additional ones, indicate some effects of changes in marital patterns, levels of fecundability, duration of post-partum non-susceptibility, age incidence of sterility and foetal wastage. In the final section of the paper, the advantages and possible applications of the model are discussed together with the limitations encountered to date in the efforts to apply the model.},

  ABSTRACT  = {The design of quality measures for approximations of the Pareto-optimal set is of high importance not only for the performance assessment, but also for the construction of multiobjective optimizers. Various measures have been proposed in the literature with the intention to capture different preferences of the decision maker. A quality measure that possesses a highly desirable feature is the hypervolume measure: whenever one approximation completely dominates another approximation, the hypervolume of the former will be greater than the hypervolume of the latter. Unfortunately, this measure - as any measure inducing a total order on the search space - is biased, in particular towards convex, inner portions of the objective space. Thus, an open question in this context is whether it can be modified such that other preferences such as a bias towards extreme solutions can be obtained. This paper proposes a methodology for quality measure design based on the hypervolume measure and demonstrates its usefulness for three types of preferences. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique increasingly used in a broad range of social sciences. It involves building a computational model consisting of agents, each of which represents an actor in the social world, and an 'environment' in which the agents act. Agents are able to interact with each other and are programmed to be pro-active, autonomous and able to perceive their virtual world. The techniques of ABM are derived from artificial intelligence and computer science, but are now being developed independently in research centers throughout the world. In Agent-Based Models, Nigel Gilbert reviews a range of examples of agent-based modeling, describes how to design and build your own models, and considers practical issues such as verification, validation, planning a modeling project, and how to structure a scholarly article reporting the results of agent-based modeling. It includes a glossary, an annotated list of resources, advice on which programming environment to use when creating agent-based models, and a worked, step-by-step example of the development of an ABM.},

  ABSTRACT = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm’s derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Alengthy and intensive debate about the role of sociology in agent based social simulation dominated the email list simsoc@jiscmail.ac.uk during the autumn of 2000. The debate turned on the importance of models being devised to capture the properties of whole social systems and whether those properties should determine agent behaviour or, conversely, whether the properties of social systems should emerge from the behaviour and interaction of the agents and, if so, how that emergence should be represented. The positions of four of the main protagonists concerned specifically with the modelling issues are reprised and extended in this symposium.},

Le point de départ sera l’état des lieux international des cursus en humanités numériques présenté à DH 2012 dans la table ronde « Digital Humanities as a university degree », organisée par M. Thaller et P. Sahle (18.07.2012). Pour la France, c’est Florence Clavaud, responsable du Master « Technologies numériques appliquées à l’histoire » à l’École nationale des chartes, qui a été contactée. L’atelier peut être l’occasion de contribuer à l’élaboration d’un questionnaire, de réfléchir aux modalités de sa diffusion et de comparer la situation française avec celle d’autres pays. Toutes les idées seront bienvenues.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is all about making choices in the presence of multiple conflicting criteria. MCDM has become one of the most important and fastest growing subfields of Operations Research/Management Science. As modern MCDM started to emerge about 50 years ago, it is now a good time to take stock of developments. This book aims to present an informal, nontechnical history of MCDM, supplemented with many pictures. It covers the major developments in MCDM, from early history until now. It also covers fascinating discoveries by Nobel Laureates and other prominent scholars. The book begins with the early history of MCDM, which covers the roots of MCDM through the 1960s. It proceeds to give a decade-by-decade account of major developments in the field starting from the 1970s until now. Written in a simple and accessible manner, this book will be of interest to students, academics, and professionals in the field of decision sciences.},

@ARTICLE{Steen2011,
  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Scientific papers are retracted for many reasons including fraud (data fabrication or falsification) or error (plagiarism, scientific mistake, ethical problems). Growing attention to fraud in the lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing. METHODS: The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction. RESULTS: Error was more common than fraud (73.5% of papers were retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6% retracted for fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5%), but 134 papers (18.1%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers retracted per year have increased sharply over the decade (r=0.96; p<0.001), as have retractions specifically for fraud (r=0.89; p<0.001). Journals now reach farther back in time to retract, both for fraud (r=0.87; p<0.001) and for scientific mistakes (r=0.95; p<0.001). Journals often fail to alert the naı̈ve reader; 31.8% of retracted papers were not noted as retracted in any way. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of misconduct appear to be higher than in the past. This may reflect either a real increase in the incidence of fraud or a greater effort on the part of journals to police the literature. However, research bias is rarely cited as a reason for retraction.},

  ABSTRACT = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

Four different approaches to deciding model validity are described; two different paradigms that relate verification and validation to the model development process are presented; various validation techniques are defined; conceptual model validity, model verification, operational validity, and data validity are discussed; a way to document results is given; a recommended procedure for model validation is presented; and accreditation is briefly discussed.},

@PHDTHESIS{Rachimow2009,
  ABSTRACT = {In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die Programmiersprache Scala auf ihre Eignung für die Entwicklung von Android-Anwendungen untersucht. Die Zahl von Programmiersprachen für die Java-Plattformnimmt ständig zu. Die Vorteile von Java sind die große Popularität, die Existenz hochwertigerWerkzeuge und Bibliotheken und die virtuellen Maschinen, die hardwareunabhängige Anwendungen ermöglichen. Die neuen Sprachen nutzen diese Vorteile und setzen alternative und moderne Konzepte um. Dazu gehört auch Scala, in der unterschiedliche Programmierparadigmen, wie die objektorientierte und die funktionale Programmierung, vereint sind. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Sprachen, die für die Java-VM entwickelt wurden, ist Scala statisch typisiert und ermöglicht trotzdem ein ausdrucksstarkes und elegantes Programmieren. Android ist ein neues auf Linux basierendes Betriebssystem für mobile Geräte, dessen Entwickler die Popularität von Java nutzen, um die Verbreitung ihres Systems zu erreichen. In die Android-Plattform ist eine Laufzeitumgebung integriert, die mit Java entwickelte Anwendungen ausführen kann. Wegen der Kompatibilität von Scala und Java ist auch der Einsatz von Scala bei der Entwicklung von Android-Anwendungen möglich. Mit dieser Arbeit wird anhand einer größeren Anwendung eingehend untersucht, ob Scala produktiv für die Android-Entwicklung geeignet ist},

  ABSTRACT  = {This paper proposes a modular ACTOR architecture and definitional method for artificial intelligence that is conceptually based on a single kind of object: actors [or, if you will, virtual processors, activation frames, or streams]. The formalism makes no presuppositions about the representation of primitive data structures and control structures. Such structures can be programmed, micro-coded, or hard wired in a uniform modular fashion. In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is "really" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives. The formalism achieves the goals that the disallowed constructs are intended to achieve by other more structured methods.},

@ARTICLE{Schmitt2013,
  ABSTRACT = {The complex system paradigm and agent-based modeling are more and more used as new approaches in social sciences. These methods and tools bring new perspectives on known facts but also allow us to test new hypotheses on social dynamics. Their use is extremely interesting in the study of how environment and society interact, and especially in the study of the emergence of urbanisation. Six models forming a 'modelography' are considered in this paper: Sugarscape, by J.M. Epstein and R. Axtell; Anasazi, from The Artificial Anasazi Project; The Village Project, from the Village Ecodynamics project; ENKIMDU, from the MASS project; SimPop, from the Géographie-cités Laboratory; and a model of urban center emergence, by A. Ourednik and P. Dessemontet. A new method to describe and compare these models is used. It will help identify the contributions or the possible improvements of the exiting modeling techniques developed to better understand this complex problem.},

@ARTICLE{Epstein1999,
  ABSTRACT = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term generative is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both inductive and deductive science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduringand especially interdisciplinaryquestions. It allows one to subject certain core theoriessuch as neoclassical microeconomicsto important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give riseor map upto macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (bottom up) models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social sciencesome related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since emer- gence figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible. 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2-4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8-11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

  ABSTRACT = {A model is a representation of something beyond itself in the sense of being used as a representative of that something, and in prompting questions of resemblance between the model and that something. Models are substitute systems that are directly examined in order to indirectly acquire information about their target systems. An experiment is an arrangement seeking to isolate a fragment of the world by controlling for causally relevant things outside that fragment. It is suggested that many theoretical models are (‘thought’) experi- ments, and that many ordinary experiments are (‘material’) models. The major difference between the two is that the controls effecting the required isolation are based},

They have been used in ecology for more than four decades, with their use and ubiquity in ecology growing rapidly in the last two decades. Individual-based models have been used for many applied or "pragmatic" issues, such as informing the protection and management of particular populations in specific locations, but their use in addressing theoretical questions has also grown rapidly, recently helping us to understand how the sets of traits of individual organisms influence the assembly of communities and food webs. Individual-based models will play an increasingly important role in questions posed by complex ecological systems.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Metaheuristics is a rather unfortunate1 term often used to describe a major subfield, indeed the primary subfield, of stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization is the general class of algorithms and techniques which employ some degree of randomness to find optimal (or as optimal as possible) solutions to hard problems. Metaheuristics are the most general of these kinds of algorithms, and are applied to a very wide range of problems. What kinds of problems? In Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964, regarding obscenity), the United States Supreme Court, Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote, I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that. Metaheuristics are applied to I know it when I see it problems. They’re algorithms used to find answers to problems when you have very little to help you: you don’t know what the optimal solution looks like, you don’t know how to go about finding it in a principled way, you have very little heuristic information to go on, and brute-force search is out of the question because the space is too large. But if you’re given a candidate solution to your problem, you can test it and assess how good it is. That is, you know a good one when you see it. For example: imagine if you’re trying to find an optimal set of robot behaviors for a soccer goalie robot. You have a simulator for the robot and can test any given robot behavior set and assign it a quality (you know a good one when you see it). And you’ve come up with a definition for what robot behavior sets look like in general. But you have no idea what the optimal behavior set is, nor even how to go about finding it.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Warren McCulloch was a significant influence on a number of British cyberneticians, as some British pioneers in this area were on him. He interacted regularly with most of the main figures on the British cybernetics scene, forming close friendships and collaborations with several, as well as mentoring others. Many of these interactions stemmed from a 1949 visit to London during which he gave the opening talk at the inaugural meeting of the Ratio Club, a gathering of brilliant, mainly young, British scientists working in areas related to cybernetics. This paper traces some of these relationships and interactions},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper performs an unprecedented comparative study of Metaheuristic optimization frameworks. As criteria for comparison a set of 271 features grouped in 30 characteristics and 6 areas has been selected. These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered, mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood specification, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation, software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface, etc. A metric has been defined for each feature so that the scores obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features, leading to a final average score for each framework. Out of 33 frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using well-defined filtering criteria, and the results of the comparison are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps in specific frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a significant lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and parallel and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices. Finally, a wider support for some metaheuristics and hybridization capabilities is needed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Abstract The problem of a groundwater model calibration is posed as a multiextremum (global) optimization problem, rather than the more widely considered single-extremum (local) optimization problem. Several algorithms of randomized search incorporated in the global optimization tool {GLOBE} are considered (including the canonical genetic algorithm and more recently developed adaptive cluster covering), and applied to the calibration of the groundwater model {TRIWACO.} The results show the usefulness of global optimization algorithms in the automatic calibration of even complex models having considerable running times.},

  ABSTRACT  = {The hypervolume measure is one of the most frequently applied measures for comparing the results of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms ({EMOA).} The idea to use this measure for selection is self-evident. A steady-state {EMOA} will be devised, that combines concepts of non-dominated sorting with a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure. The algorithm computes a well distributed set of solutions with bounded size thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front(s). By means of standard benchmark problems the algorithm will be compared to other well established {EMOA.} The results show that our new algorithm achieves good convergence to the Pareto front and outperforms standard methods in the hypervolume covered.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Traditionally, researchers have used elaborate regression models to simulate the retail petrol market. Such models are limited in their ability to model individual behaviour and geographical influences. Heppenstall et al presented a novel agent-based framework for modelling individual petrol stations as agents and integrated important additional system behaviour through the use of established methodologies such as spatial interaction models. The parameters for this model were initially determined by the use of real data analysis and experimentation. This paper explores the parameterisation and verification of the model through data analysis and by use of a genetic algorithm ({GA).} The results show that a {GA} can be used to produce not just an optimised match, but results that match those derived by expert analysis through rational exploration. This may suggest that despite the apparent nonlinear and complex nature of the system, there are a limited number of optimal or near optimal behaviours given its constraints, and that both user-driven and {GA} solutions converge on them.},

  ABSTRACT = {Since the beginning of AI, mind games have been studied as relevant application fields. Nowadays, some programs are better than human players in most classical games. Their results highlight the efficiency of AI methods that are now quite standard. Such methods are very useful to Go programs, but they do not enable a strong Go program to be built. The problems related to Computer Go require new AI problem solving methods. Given the great number of problems and the diversity of possible solutions, Computer Go is an attractive research domain for AI. Prospective methods of programming the game of Go will probably be of interest in other domains as well. The goal of this paper is to present Computer Go by showing the links between existing studies on Computer Go and different AI related domains: evaluation function, heuristic search, machine learning, automatic knowledge generation, mathematical morphology and cognitive science. In addition, this paper describes both the practical aspects of Go programming, such as program optimization, and various theoretical aspects such as combinatorial game theory, mathematical morphology, and Monte Carlo methods. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

@ARTICLE{Wu1998,
  ABSTRACT = {Cellular automata (CA) simulation has become a popular method of exploring the behaviour of all kinds of self-organising systems. The city may clearly be viewed as such a system but one with a particularly complex set of transition rules. Many natural processes such as the spread of fire or vegetation can be modelled by a simple set of local rules. Insofar as the development of a piece of land depends on the neighbourhood situation as well as on the characteristics of a site, urban evolution can be treated in much the same way, with transition rules translating the evaluation of the location into a land conversion outcome. If this modelling paradigm is to be used to gain insight into real-world urban development processes, there is a need to discover ways of capturing the richness of land conversion behaviour in the simplifying mechanisms of CA. Our paper contributes to this research agenda by integrating multicriteria evaluation (MCE) into a CA simulation in order to define nondeterministic, multidimensional, and multilevel transition rules. An analytical hierarchy process is used to implement MCE-derived transition rules. The integrated MCE - CA model may be used in a gaming mode to explore how urban form evolves under different development regimes caricatured by the set of multicriteria weights. We use it to test loosely hypotheses about the nature of the regimes that have governed the expansion of a fast-growing southern Chinese city.},

  ABSTRACT      = {This paper summarises the history of the terms ecology and ecosystem, before examining their application in the early and recent literature of A-Life agent-based software simulation. It investigates trends in A-Life that have led to a predominance of simulations incorporating artificial evolution acting on generic agents, but lacking a level of detail that would allow the emergence of phenomena relating to the transfer and transformation of energy and matter between the virtual abiotic environment and biota. Implications of these characteristics for the relevance of A-Life’s virtual ecosystem models to Ecology are discussed. We argue a position that the inclusion of low-level representations of energetics, matter and evolution, in concert with pattern-oriented modelling techniques from Ecology for model validation, will improve the relevance of A-Life models to Ecology. We also suggest two methods that may allows us to meet this goal: artificial evolution can be employed as a mechanism for automating pattern-oriented ecological modelling from the level of individual species up to that of the ecosystem, or it may be employed to explore general principles of ecosystem behaviour over evolutionary time periods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Entropy in Urban and Regional Modelling introduced a new framework for construct- ing spatial interaction and associated location models. These ideas are reviewed briefly and then set in the wider context of the application of entropy in a range of disciplines. Related developments since 1970 are examined with particular reference to extensions of the core model, links to mathematical programming, the relationship to economics, and the introduction of a dynamic spatial structure hypothesis. The role of entropy maximizing in geography, and more widely in complexity science, is re- viewed and two conclusions are drawn beyond the continued effective deployment of entropy models: geography could be a leading player as complexity science develops; and geography can use these ideas to update the presentation of its classic theories. The ongoing research agenda is extensive—particularly in relation to the modeling of imperfect markets in economics—in its links with network science and agent-based modeling. Recent developments in physics suggest a new role for entropy in under- standing spatial structure. This article is organized into five main sections. The first summarizes the ideas of the book; the second sets this discussion in a wider context; the third surveys the developments that have taken place since its publication. The fourth summarizes the role of entropy maximizing in geography in the context of complexity science, and the fifth presents an ongoing research agenda.},

The example studied the first stages in the building of termites' nest show the importance of such a formulation. The essential points are : 1 ~{} Knowing the interactions mechanism between the different elements of the system or by making a series of hypotheses it is possible to formulate a system of differential equations the study of which gives an image of the eolleetive behaviour of the group. 2 ~{} The innovations and fluctuations of the elements of the system (concentrations of individuals, odor, nest's elements, etc.) constitute an essential element of the strnc- turation of such systems which seems to be in perfect agreement with the experimental observations showing the role of fluctuating elements of a colony.},

  ABSTRACT    = {High Performance Computing (HPC) plays a pivotal role in stimulating Europe’s economic growth. HPC is a pervasive tool allowing industry and academia to develop world class products, services and inventions in order to maintain and reinforce Europe’s position on the competitive worldwide arena. HPC is also recognized as crucial in addressing grand societal challenges. “Today, to Out-Compute is to Out-Compete” best describes the role of HPC. To sustain its competitiveness, Europe needs to enhance its innovation capabilities using HPC. However: ? Today, HPC is mostly used in large HPC research centres and some large enterprises. It needs to become much more pervasive across the entire industry, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). ? While Europe represents a significant portion of the world’s available HPC resources, only a fraction of that technology and infrastructure is developed in Europe. ? Other regions invest considerably more in new technologies, architectures and software for HPC systems, gaining a substantial competitive edge over Europe. An industry-led initiative, a European Technology Platform (ETP) for High Performance Computing, is being formed to address these issues. This ETP will define research priorities for the development of a globally competitive HPC technology ecosystem in Europe. It will propose and help to implement a Strategic Research Agenda, while acting as the “one voice” of the European HPC industry in relations with the European Commission and national authorities. The creation of this ETP fits perfectly with a European Commission’s recommendation made in its recent communication1 about HPC. The timing of forming this ETP is right for two reasons: ? The coming Horizon 2020 Programme calls for a solid and energetic engagement in defining the HPC research content. ? We are at a crossroads: while new business models demand a new way of deploying – and designing – HPC systems, the technologies used today will not support the requirements of the next ten years. Thus, new approaches, technologies and methodologies are required. We must “act now”. Otherwise, the societal and economic benefits of a vibrant HPC ecosystem will not be realised. The ETP strongly recommends launching a research program with an aim to develop European technology in all segments of the HPC solution value chain. The ETP4HPC is ready to work with other stakeholders to implement such a research program, in order to develop a European HPC technology ecosystem and to help European HPC achieve recognized leadership. This can be achieved through a research program that builds on the current strengths, takes advantage of technological disruptions with a tangible and sustainable market potential, chooses technologies that meet the needs of important applications, facilitates the creation of start-ups and the development of the SME sector and utilizes synergies with other Information Technology sectors. We recommend prioritizing research in the following break-through technologies: ? Architecture evolution ? Energy driven HPC ? Extreme parallelism ? Programming paradigms, algorithms, HPC libraries and compilers ? Resiliency ? System Software ? Scaling I/O and storage with processing ? New storage solutions for big data ? Evolution of HPC workloads We believe that such a research portfolio will help Europe build a competitive and sustainable HPC industry and ecosystem, produce world-class solutions for both academic and industrial purposes, reduce its reliance on technologies from other regions, increase the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of other existing industries, and address grand societal challenges.},

@ARTICLE{Williamson2011,
  ABSTRACT = {Discrete optimization problems are everywhere, from traditional operations research planning problems, such as scheduling, facility location, and network design; to computer science problems in databases; to advertising issues in viral marketing. Yet most such problems are NP-hard. Thus unless P = NP, there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions to such problems. This book shows how to design approximation algorithms: efficient algorithms that find provably near-optimal solutions. The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first part of the book is devoted to a single algorithmic technique, which is then applied to several different problems. The second part revisits the techniques but offers more sophisticated treatments of them. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate. Designed as a textbook for graduate-level algorithms courses, the book will also serve as a reference for researchers interested in the heuristic solution of discrete optimization problems.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is now some 50 years since the advent of discrete-event simulation in the form of the development of the General Simulation Program (GSP) by KD Tocher and his team. The paper considers this innovative step in the context of the earlier history of operational research (OR), simulation and computing hardware and software, for example, being before the emergence of high-level languages. The paper discusses the industrial stimulus for the GSP idea and the pioneering path followed. That GSP work opened the way to a tool that has grown in popularity steadily over time to be now recognized as the most frequently used of the classical OR techniques.},

First, the theory of chaos tells us that short-term predictions of nonlinear systems will be difficult, and long-term predictions will be impossible. The grave Implications this has for ecology are only just beginning to be understood. Second, ecologists have started to recognize the importance of local interactions between individuals in ecological systems. And third, improvements in computer power and software are making computers more inviting as a primary tool for modelling. The combination of these factors may have far-reaching consequences for ecological theory.},

  ABSTRACT  = {The most exciting development in parallel computer architecture is the convergence of traditionally disparate approaches on a common machine structure. This book explains the forces behind this convergence of shared-memory, message-passing, data parallel, and data-driven computing architectures. It then examines the design issues that are critical to all parallel architecture across the full range of modern design, covering data access, communication performance, coordination of cooperative work, and correct implementation of useful semantics. It not only describes the hardware and software techniques for addressing each of these issues but also explores how these techniques interact in the same system. Examining architecture from an application-driven perspective, it provides comprehensive discussions of parallel programming for high performance and of workload-driven evaluation, based on understanding hardware-software interactions. synthesizes a decade of research and development for practicing engineers, graduate students, and researchers in parallel computer architecture, system software, and applications development presents in-depth application case studies from computer graphics, computational science and engineering, and data mining to demonstrate sound quantitative evaluation of design trade-offs describes the process of programming for performance, including both the architecture-independent and architecture-dependent aspects, with examples and case-studies illustrates bus-based and network-based parallel systems with case studies of more than a dozen important commercial designs},

  ABSTRACT = {The field of metaheuristics for the application to combinatorial optimization problems is $backslash$na rapidly growing field of research. This is due to the importance of combinatorial $backslash$noptimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world.We give a survey $backslash$nof the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view.We $backslash$noutline the different components and concepts that are used in the different $backslash$nmetaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very $backslash$nimportant concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are $backslash$nthe two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some $backslash$nway contrary but also complementary to each other.We introduce a framework, that we $backslash$ncall the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification $backslash$ncomponents into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages $backslash$nof different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of $backslash$nhybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other $backslash$nmethods for optimization.},

@ARTICLE{Fletcher1986,
  ABSTRACT   = {Site sizes have been reported by archaeologists all over the world in the past 150 years. Now that numerous site size reports are becoming available from contract work and surveys for cultural resource management as well as from regional research programmes we need seriously to consider whether there really is sufficient intercompatibility for this mass of data to be generally useful. Despite assumptions about inter-regional inconsistencies in data collection there appears to be a world-wide consistency in the way site size has been identified. Consistent patterns of site size distribution and rates of change are recognisable. Site size appears to be adequate as a gross referent of settlement size. A behavioural model of the interaction and communication constraints on community life provides an explanation of the large scale processes of settlement growth.},

@ARTICLE{Metropolis1987,
  ABSTRACT = {The year was 1945. Two earth-shaking events took place: the successful test at Alamogordo and the building of the first electronic computer. Their combined impact was to modify qualitatively the nature of global interactions between Russia and the West. No less perturbative were the changes wrought in all of academic research and in applied science. On a less grand scale these events brought about a renascence of a mathematical technique known to the old guard as statistical sampling; in its new surroundings and owing to its nature, there was no denying its new name of the Monte Carlo method. This essay attempts to describe the details that led to this renascence and the roles played by the various actors. It is appropriate that it appears in an issue dedicated to Stan Ulam.},

  ABSTRACT  = {How do social structures and group behaviors arise from the interaction of individuals? Growing Artificial Societies approaches this question with cutting-edge computer simulation techniques. Fundamental collective behaviors such as group formation, cultural transmission, combat, and trade are seen to "emerge" from the interaction of individual agents following a few simple rules. In their program, named Sugarscape, Epstein and Axtell begin the development of a "bottom up" social science that is capturing the attention of researchers and commentators alike. The study is part of the 2050 Project, a joint venture of the Santa Fe Institute, the World Resources Institute, and the Brookings Institution. The project is an international effort to identify conditions for a sustainable global system in the next century and to design policies to help achieve such a system.},

@ARTICLE{Pumain1983,
  ABSTRACT      = {Comment et pourquoi l'analyse quantitative s'est progressivement imposée auprès d'une minorité importante de chercheurs français en géographie urbaine ? L'article répond à ces questions. L'incursion des géographes urbains dans ces nouveaux champs méthodologiques et techniques a beaucoup contribué à la vitalité des recherches urbaines et ce pour plusieurs raisons. La première est que grâce à la généralisation de l'outil informatique et aux possibilités de l'analyse multivariée des vérifications jusque là irréalisables ont pu être faites dans différents domaines, et que par ailleurs de nouveaux champs d'observation ont été ouverts (exemple : la télédétection). La seconde est que les démarches mises ainsi en œuvre ont renvoyé le chercheur à des exigences beaucoup plus grandes en matière d'explicitation théorique, de conceptualisation, et de rigueur de l'observation. Les tenants de cette démarche se trouvent donc très étroitement impliqués dans l'ensemble des débats et confrontations qui animent depuis une dizaine d'années la géographie urbaine française. Aujourd'hui, les voies ouvertes par la modélisation et l'analyse des systèmes apportent de nouvelles perspectives à l'investigation urbaine.},

@BOOK{Ceruzzi2000,
  ABSTRACT = {This book covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities. A history of computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer to the Web and dot-com crash. From the first digital computer to the dot-com crash-a story of individuals, institutions, and the forces that led to a series of dramatic transformations. This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash.},

@ARTICLE{Merz1991,
  ABSTRACT = {Representative and reliable individual time use data, in connection with a proper set of socio-economic back-ground variables, are essential elements for the empirical foundation and evaluation of existing and new theories in general and in particular for time use analyses. Within the international project Assessing Time Use Survey Datasets several potentially useful individual US time use heritage datasets have been identified for use in de-veloping an historical series of non-market accounts. In order to evaluate the series of American Heritage Time Use Data (AHTUD) (1965, 1975, 1985, 1992-94, 1998-99) this paper analyses the representativeness of this data when using given weights and provides a new harmonised calibration of the AHTUD for sound time use analyses. Our calibration procedure with its ADJUST program package is theoretically founded on information theory, consistent with a simultaneous weighting including hierarchical data, ensures desired positive weights, and is well-suited and available for any time use data calibration of interest. We present the calibration approach and provide new harmonised weights for all AHTUD surveys based on a substantially driven calibration frame-work. To illustrate the various application possibilities of a calibration, we finally disentangle demographic vs. time use behavioural changes and developments by re-calibrating all five AHTUD surveys using 1965 popula-tion totals as a benchmark.},

  ABSTRACT      = {When attempting to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of an algorithm, it is important to have a strong understanding of the problem at hand. This is true for the field of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as it is for any other field. Many of the multiobjective test problems employed in the EA literature have not been rigorously analyzed, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms tested on them. In this paper, we systematically review and analyze many problems from the EA literature, each belonging to the important class of real-valued, unconstrained, multiobjective test problems. To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions. Our analysis of test problems highlights a number of areas requiring attention. Not only are many test problems poorly constructed but also the important class of nonseparable problems, particularly nonseparable multimodal problems, is poorly represented. Motivated by these findings, we present a flexible toolkit for constructing well-designed test problems. We also present empirical results demonstrating how the toolkit can be used to test an optimizer in ways that existing test suites do not},

  ABSTRACT = {In my dictionary I find a synthesis defined as “a complex whole made up of a number of parts united.” The suggestions of complexity and unity are bothersome, however, because the synthesis of approaches to regional analy- sis presented in this paper is simplistic at best, and we have all found that the parts hardly seem united at times. There is perhaps only one advantage to be gained from the simplifi- cation-that proaches to studying the geography of an area may be identified more readily. The paper begins with certain assertions con- cerning geography’s role among the sciences. A synthesis of apparently dichotomous ap- proaches to geographic understanding is then proposed, and the concluding remarks are directed to the question of new approaches. The route towards such new approaches be- gins with analysis of the inadequacies of the proposed synthesis, and continues with dis- cussion of possible solutions to the inade- quacies via generalizations produced in General Systems Theory.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the Connection Machine, a programmable computer based on cellular automata. The essential idea behind the connection machine is that a regular locally-connected cellular array can be made to behave as if the processing cells are connected into any desired topology. When the topology of the machine is chosen to match the topology of the application program, the result is a fast, powerful computing engine. The Connection Machine was originally designed to implement knowledge retrieval operations in artificial intelligence programs, but the hardware and the programming techniques are apparently applicable to a much larger class of problems. A machine with 100,000 processing cells is currently being constructed.},

With all this activity. there has been a atural tendency to equate GAs with function optimization. However. e motivating context of HoUand's initial GA work was the design d implementation of robust adaptive systems. In this paper we argue t a proper understanding of GAs in this broader adaptive systems on text is a necessary prerequisite for understanding their potential pplication to any problem domain. We then use these insights to tter understand the strengths and limitations of GAs as function ptimizers.},

  ABSTRACT  = {By considering the function variables rather than the binary-bits as genes, new mutation operators can be devised for {GAs} used to optimise numeric functions. We implement Gaussian mutation operators for genetic algorithms used to optimise numeric functions and show it is superior to bit-flip mutation for most of the test functions. Gaussian mutation is a fundamental operator of both evolutionary strategies ({ES)} and evolutionary programming ({EP).} We also implement self-adaptive Gaussian mutation (also used in evolutionary strategies and evolutionary programming) which allows the {GA} to vary the mutation strength during the run, this gives further improvement on some of the functions. The performance of our {GA} using a simple implementation of self-adaptive Gaussian mutation is now comparable to {ESs.} This shows the importance of mutation and the importance of using appropriate mutation operators},

  ABSTRACT      = {The authors discuss their efforts to make computer programming accessible and the principles that guided them in designing their programming language, Scratch. Scratch, available at http://scratch.mit.edu, is aimed toward children between the ages of eight and 16 to encourage their digital fluency. The philosophy of the authors is that digital fluency involves more than the ability to chat, interact and search, but also the ability to design new media. They suggest that programming encourages computational thinking and problem-solving processes.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Design, Make, Play: Growing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators is a resource for practitioners, policymakers, researchers and program developers that illuminates creative, cutting edge ways to inspire and motivate young people about science and technology learning. The book is aligned with the National Research Council’s new Framework for Science Education, which includes an explicit focus on engineering and design content, as well as integration across disciplines. Extensive case studies explore real world examples of innovative programs that take place in a variety of settings, including schools, museums, community centers, and virtual spaces. Design, Make, and Play are presented as learning methodologies that have the power to rekindle children’s intrinsic motivation and innate curiosity about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. A digital companion app showcases rich multimedia that brings the stories and successes of each program—and the students who learn there—to life. Show less},

  ABSTRACT = {The writings of Joseph Henry Woodger (1894-1981) are often taken to exemplify everything that was wrongheaded, misguided, and just plain wrong with early twentieth-century philosophy of biology. Over the years, commentators have said of Woodger: (a) that he was a fervent logical empiricist who tried to impose the explanatory gold standards of physics onto biology, (b) that his philosophical work was completely disconnected from biological science, (c) that he possessed no scientific or philosophical credentials, and (d) that his work was disparaged - if not altogether ignored - by the biologists and philosophers of his era. In this paper, we provide the first systematic examination of Woodger's oeuvre, and use it to demonstrate that the four preceding claims are false. We argue that Woodger's ideas have exerted an important influence on biology and philosophy, and submit that the current consensus on his legacy stems from a highly selective reading of his works. By rehabilitating Woodger, we hope to show that there is no good reason to continue to disregard the numerous contributions to the philosophy of biology produced in the decades prior to the professionalization of the discipline.},

  ABSTRACT      = {The paper is concerned with understanding the geography of intellectual creativity and change using as a case study the quantitative revolution in geography. First, I review briefly the sea change occurring over the last 40 years in understanding intellectual production, and made most forcefully in the literature in the sociology of scientific knowledge. I highlight three elements: the nature and persistence of intellectual breaks and ruptures; the embodiedness and material embeddedness of the intellectual process; and the centrality of networks and alliances. Secondly, I take each of these three components of intellectual production, and work them through different theories of place to illuminate the role of the geographical within each. In particular, I argue that the geography of intellectual rupture is clarified by using Michel Foucault’s notion of heterotopia, that the place of intellectual embodiment and embeddedness is elucidated by Kevin Hetherington and John Law’sworkonmateriality,and that spacesof network and alliance are enhanced by the recent writings on place by Nigel Thrift. Finally, using these three features I present an interpretive analysis of the place of geography’s quantitative revolution drawing upon 36 oral histories I conducted with first- and second- generation pioneers of that movement.

  ABSTRACT  = {A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9x9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.},

  ABSTRACT = {Video games allow complex systems modelling, revealing retroaction loops, replicating self-organization and the emergence of hierarchical organization, functional differentiation and social segregation through multi-level interactions. Recent trends focus on improving modelling tools’ graphic quality and interface attractiveness and on using video games to facilitate urban studies teaching and research. This apparent convergence between simulation and video games is addressed through a selection of strategy and city builder video games. Comparisons reveal that simulations and video games point to similar results:, they both allow the simulation of complex urban processes, like hierarchical urban networks or urban segregation. Games even seem to allow going one step further, being often more comprehensive simulations. However, the main limitation of video games emerges from their didactic power: video games and simulation software implement rules and models in almost opposite means. Games induce players to learn the model but not to challenge or to produce new knowledge.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Abstract: Peter Allan’s Intra-urban model is a very appealing application of bifurcation theory for simulating the evolution of an urban spatial structure. It is actually a spatial dynamic model, and it brings together many well-known empirical regularities and well-established theoretic proposals, as logistic growth, economic base theory, distance-decay functions, urban ecology and actor’s behaviour in an urban context. Until now, this model has only been tested in fictitious urban situations and did prove its ability to simulate various urban evolutions, especially of the north-american type. However, it needs to be tested in real-world situations. Main questions are: Until which extent the same set of equations is able to simulate various observed urban evolution; and how many changes in parameters’ values are necessary to reproduce observed evolution in different towns. So we tried to apply the model to a sample of fench metropolitan areas.},

  ABSTRACT = {An urban cellular automata model has been designed, developed and tested for the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia as a research project. The model uses fuzzy set theory to capture the uncertainty associated with the transition rules and employs two automated methods of calibration: a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. This paper describes the results of the calibration process for three time periods: 1987-1997, 1997-2005 and 1987-2005, which are characterised by different patterns of urban development. Nine different scenarios have been devised to capture the effect of different primary drivers to development including transport, urban agglomeration and topography and their interactions. The results showed that the genetic algorithm produces a better calibrated model than parallel simulated annealing. The model that contains all primary drivers and all interactions produced the best performing calibrated model overall. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {This thesis deals with the polynomial approximability of combinatorial opti- mization problems which are NP-complete in their decision problem version. Different measures of approximation quality are possible and give rise to differ- ent approximation preserving reductions and different approximation classes of problems. We present definitions and characteristics of existing measures, re- ductions and classes and make comparisons. The main contributions comprise the following four subjects. • We show that the definition of the approximability class Max SNP due to Panconesi and Ranjan differs from the original definition due to Pa- padimitriou and Yannakakis and that the same problem may or may not be included in the class depending on how it is encoded. A new definition of Max SNP without this limitation is proposed. • We prove that maximum three dimensional matching is Max SNP-hard using a reduction constructing a structure of rings of trees. Using similar techniques we can show that several othermatching and packing problems are Max SNP-hard, for example the maximum H-matching problem (the problem of determining the maximum number of node-disjoint copies of a fixed graph H contained in a variable graph). Most of the problems are Max SNP-complete when bounding the degree of the input structure. • Some versions of the maximum common subgraph problem are studied and approximation algorithms are given. The maximum bounded com- mon induced subgraph problem is shown to be Max SNP-hard and the maximum unbounded common induced subgraph problem is shown to be as hard to approximate as the maximum independent set problem. The maximum common induced connected subgraph problem is still harder to approximate and is shown to be NPO PB-complete, i.e. complete in the class of optimization problems with optimum value bounded by a polynomial. • An algorithm which solves the Euclidean travelling salesperson problem in two dimensions optimally is given. The worst case time bound for the algorithm is 2O(√nlogn). As an appendix there is a list of NP optimization problems including their definitions, approximation properties and references. Keywords:},

  ABSTRACT = {In order to simulate the evolution of a system of settlements with a dynamic model, many processes must be integrated: the spatial aggregation of population, the complexification of urban activities, and the increasing hierarchical differentiation of settlements. The model must also simulate the progressive structuration of the settlement system through a growing variety and enlarged range of interactions between its elements. {“Multiagent} systems” provides a flexible modeling method for dealing with the multiple spatial interactions of cooperation and competition and relations that generate and regulate the evolution of a settlement system. Its principles are described and applied to building an evolutionary model, including a simulation tool. The model combines economic and spatial rules to produce birth, growth, decline, and functional diversification of the towns. The “urban transition” from an agrarian settlement system toward a hierarchical system of trade- and manufacturing-oriented towns and cities can be simulated.},

  ABSTRACT  = {A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The method$backslash$n can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search$backslash$n with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up$backslash$n the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively$backslash$n changes from averaging to min-max as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control of the$backslash$n tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The resulting algorithm was implemented$backslash$n in a 9×9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.},

  ABSTRACT = {The study of self-replicating structures or machines has been taking place now for almost half a century. My goal in this article is to present an overview of research carried out in the domain of self-replication over the past 50 years, starting from von Neumann's work in the late 1940s and continuing to the most recent research efforts. I shall concentrate on computational models, that is, ones that have been studied from a computer science point of view, be it theoretical or experimental. The systems are divided into four major classes, according to the model on which they are based: cellular automata, computer programs, strings (or strands), or an altogether different approach. With the advent of new materials, such as synthetic molecules and nanomachines, it is quite possible that we shall see this somewhat theoretical domain of study producing practical, real-world applications.},

  ABSTRACT = {Using an example of a computer simulation of the convective structure of a red giant star, this paper argues that simulation is a rich inferential process, and not simply a 'number crunching' technique. The scientific practice of simulation, moreover, poses some interesting and challenging epistemological and methodological issues for the philosophy of science. I will also argue that these challenges would be best addressed by a philosophy of science that places less emphasis on the representational capacity of theories (and ascribes that capacity instead to models) and more emphasis on the role of theory in guiding (rather than determining) the construction of models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.) was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.},

  ABSTRACT      = {Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2-4], and journal [5,6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8-11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested datasets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a dataset being extant fell by 17% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working email address for the first, last or corresponding author fell by 7% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

Nous présentons dans ce chapitre di érents algorithmes utilisés pour les jeux. Les jeux sont étudiés en Intelligence Arti cielle depuis ses origines. His- Nous commençons par deux sections sur les jeux à deux joueurs, la première traite de l'Alpha-Beta et de certaines de ses optimisations, la deuxième porte sur les algorithmes de Monte-Carlo qui ont donné récemment de très bons résultats sur certains jeux et qui ont une portée très générale. On peut noter au passage les contributions essentiellement françaises aux algorithmes de Monte-Carlo, on peut même parler d'une école française du Monte-Carlo dans les jeux. Nous abordons ensuite les puzzles et l'analyse rétrograde. Nous concluons avec une section sur les jeux vidéo.},

@ARTICLE{Wu2002,
  ABSTRACT = {Despite the recognition of cellular automata (CA) as a flexible and powerful tool for urban growth simulation, the calibration of CA had been largely heuristic until recent efforts to incorporate multi-criteria evaluation and artificial neural network into rule definition. This study developed a stochastic CA model, which derives its initial probability of simulation from observed sequential land use data. Furthermore, this initial probability is updated dynamically through local rules based on the strength of neighbourhood development. Consequentially the integration of global (static) and local (dynamic) factors produces more realistic simulation results. The procedure of calibrated CA can be applied in other contexts with minimum modification. In this study we applied the procedure to simulate rural-urban land conversions in the city of Guangzhou, China. Moreover, the study suggests the need to examine the result of CA through spatial, tabular and structural validation.},

  ABSTRACT  = {In recent years, the field of combinatorial optimization has witnessed a true tsunami of “novel” metaheuristic methods, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together – it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics.},

  ABSTRACT    = {POPSIM, a dynamic demographic model designed for computer simulation of the principal demographic processes occurring in human populations is described. Since the model generates a vital event history, including the dates of birth, marriage, divorce or widowhood, remarriage, and death for each individual in the computer population, it is classed as a microsimulation model. It is a 2-sex model and may be used for simulating either cohort or period data. POPSIM is a stochastic, rather than a deterministic model in that random sampling of probability distributions is used to determine which events occur to each individual and when they occur. It is a dynamic model since it permits the probabilities to change with time. The model can be made self-adjusting through the use of feedback mechanisms. For example, feedback models to account for the effect of changing marriage patterns on marriage rates have been developed. - See more at:},

  ABSTRACT  = {This unique book brings together a comprehensive set of papers on the background, theory, technical issues and applications of agent-based modelling ({ABM)} within geographical systems. {ABM} is starting to mature as a methodology in geography and across the social sciences, and this volume draws together the different strands and main issues of such research. In this book a thorough background to the premise of {ABM} and other commonly used geo-computational techniques is presented. It will help to organise the diverse landscape of {ABM} by bringing together essays on theoretical and practical applications of {ABM} in spatial systems, thereby discussing in detail issues, pros and cons with realistically modelling the spatially influenced systems and linking to past modelling theory (for the first time tracing {ABM} {evolution).Part} 1 presents an overview of the most commonly used geocomputational methods in geography. Part 2 examines the principles and concepts underlying {ABM.} Part 3 follows on from part 2 by providing an overview and guidance to many of the common and new technical issues that modellers face when creating an {ABM.} The final section draws together a wide range of applications from the micro to macro scale of geographical systems and sets out an agenda for future areas of promising {ABM} research.},

  ABSTRACT = {The RNetLogo package delivers an interface to embed the agent-based modeling platform NetLogo into the R environment with headless (no graphical user interface) or interactive GUI mode. It provides functions to load models, execute commands, push values, and to get values from NetLogo reporters. Such a seamless integration of a widely used agent-based modeling platform with a well-known statistical computing and graphics environment opens up various possibilities. For example, it enables the modeler to design simulation experiments, store simulation results, and analyze simulation output in a more systematic way. It can therefore help close the gaps in agent-based modeling regarding standards of description and analysis. After a short overview of the agent-based modeling approach and the software used here, the paper delivers a step-by-step introduction to the usage of the RNetLogo package by examples.},

  ABSTRACT  = {This paper explores how model-based reasoning might be characterized in terms of making experiments. I outline the characteristic steps of such model experiments or "experiements on models", and apply the notions of a diagrammatic model in everyday use in economics. I compare these model experiments with two other kinds of experiments (using examples from the same economic domain): laboratory experiments and a hybrid form. This hybrid form involves simulations or "experiements with models". The paper concludes with a comparison of the role that models play in each case.},

  ABSTRACT = {In trying to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-pr...},

  ABSTRACT  = {Welcome to Clever Algorithms! This is a handbook of recipes for com- putational problem solving techniques from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics. Clever Algorithms are interesting, practical, and fun to learn about and implement. Research scientists may be interested in browsing algorithm inspirations in search of an interesting system or process analogs to investigate. Developers and software engineers may compare various problem solving algorithms and technique-specific guidelines. Practitioners, students, and interested amateurs may implement state-of-the-art algorithms to address business or scientific needs, or simply play with the fascinating systems they represent. This introductory chapter provides relevant background information on Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms. The core of the book provides a large corpus of algorithms presented in a complete and consistent manner. The final chapter covers some advanced topics to consider once a number of algorithms have been mastered. This book has been designed as a reference text, where specific techniques are looked up, or where the algorithms across whole fields of study can be browsed, rather than being read cover-to-cover. This book is an algorithm handbook and a technique guidebook, and I hope you find something useful.},

Chapters one through four, respectively, (1) examine the use of digital computers in the teaching of college geography, (2) analyze the von Thunen theory which postulates laws that influence the prices of agricultural products and the way in which price variations are subsequently translated into patterns of agricultural land use, (3) describe the Landuse program which is based upon the von Thunen model, and (4) present six cases which demonstrate the versatility, flexibility, and applicability of the program. The appendix includes detailed operating and key punching instructions for the Landuse program and for computer programs in general. Also included is a distribution address of the Geography Program Exchange (GPE) which has been established to assist universities and other non-profit organizations with the interchange of computer software that relates to problems of geographic nature.

  ABSTRACT  = {The development of any science depends on systematic empirical study and systematic conceptual elaboration. Proceeding on the assumption that the study of human society can become a true science, the author examines the contribution that various mathematical techniques might make to systematic conceptual elaboration of social behaviour. He notes that it is only when the logical structure of relations between concepts becomes clear and precise that the shift to a formal structure of mathematics is possible, and claims that in this way mathematics will ultimately become useful in sociology. The applications of various mathematical techniques are elaborated and illustrated with reference to particular types of social studies. The first chapter surveys the variety of styles of mathematics at present used in sociology and the purposes to which they are put. Problems of measurement are considered in Chapter 2; and in Chapters 3 to 13 attempts are made to develop a "mathematical language" to embrace social and psychological processes. This is followed in the next three chapters by consideration of problems of social structure and interaction. Chapter 17 combines "structure" and "process" models. In conclusion Chapter 18 makes explicit the tactics and strategies underlying the development of the earlier parts. Mathematical tools progress from simple algebra to matrix analysis and the substantial use of calculus. Causal relations between attributes are represented by the mathematics of continuous-time stochastic processes which are extended into a consistent mathematical attribute data. This framework is used as a practical tool of multi-variate analysis for attribute data, ordered classifications and unordered classifications, and may be applied at both group and individual levels to a wide variety of problems. The author predicts that knowledge of advanced probability theory and advanced calculus will soon become necessary for further development of the subject. E.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Contributions to this edition of Computer Methods have been extensively revised and contain much new material—updating the proceedings of a conference held in 1964 at the Joint Center for Urban Studies of MIT and Harvard University. In this conference, social scientists experienced in computer use compared notes on the problems and benefits encountered in their studies with beginners in computer analysis. Initiated by the preparation and release of the 1-1,000 sample tape of the US census, the conference provided a means by which social scientists, deluged with data, could master the great influx of information. Three major themes emerge in this collection of papers: control over the computer processes by the social scientists (a unifying theme throughout the book), the implications of time (complex feedback relationships), and the level of aggregation (individual and aggregate theories) in the interpretation of social science data. The book raises important substantive issues as social scientists and other "applications" people attempt to develop procedures for greater control over the computer.},

  ABSTRACT      = {The French Learned Society for Computer Scientists, AFCET (Association Fran&amp;#x0E7;aise pour la Cybern&amp;#x0E9;tique Economique et Technique) originated in 1968 with the merger of four associations for automatic control, operational research, information processing, and instrumentation and control, all of which were considered to be components of the term "cybernetics." The novelty of this process explains how difficult it was for computer science to be recognized in the manner that computer scientists desired, both in AFCET and in the university. Discussion regarding cybernetics, which has continued in the background within AFCET, has emerged again today to respond to questions posed by artificial intelligence in its most advanced developments.},

These early works include industrial dynamics, urban dynamics, world dynamics, and the national economic model. The paper continues with an assessment of the present condition of the field.

  ABSTRACT  = {Since 1985 various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed, capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. But the few comparative studies of different methods available to date are mostly qualitative and restricted to two approaches. In this paper an extensive, quantitative comparison is presented, applying four multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to an extended 0/1 knapsack problem.},

Starting from a survey of history the philosophical background is explained in order to make understandable why ES are realized in the way they are. Basic ES algorithms and design principles for variation and selection operators as well as theoretical issues are presented, and future branches of ES research are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT    = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms which use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been mainly criticized for their (i) O(MN 3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size), (ii) non-elitism approach, and (iii) the need for specifying a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (we called it the Non-dominated Sorting GA-II or NSGA-II) which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN 2) computational complexity is presented. Second, a selection operator is presented which creates a mating pool by combining the parent and child populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on five difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to PAES and SPEAtwo other elitist multi-objective EAs which pay special attention towards creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Because of NSGA-IIs low computational requirements, elitist approach, and parameter-less sharing approach, NSGA-II should find increasing applications in the years to come.},

  ABSTRACT      = {After using evolutionary techniques for single-objective optimization during more than two decades, the incorporation of more than one objective in the fitness function has finally become a popular area of research. As a consequence, many new evolutionary-based approaches and variations of existing techniques have recently been published in the technical literature. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the information on these current approaches, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the operations research techniques in which most of them are based, in an attempt to motivate researchers to look into these mathematical programming approaches for new ways of exploiting the search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms.

  ABSTRACT = {Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapies (HAART) can prolong life significantly to people infected by HIV since, although unable to eradicate the virus, they are quite effective in maintaining control of the infection. However, since HAART have several undesirable side effects, it is considered useful to suspend the therapy according to a suitable schedule of Structured Therapeutic Interruptions (STI). In the present article we describe an application of genetic algorithms (GA) aimed at finding the optimal schedule for a HAART simulated with an agent-based model (ABM) of the immune system that reproduces the most significant features of the response of an organism to the HIV-1 infection.},

Le développement de ce trio de logiciels s’est déroulé sur une quinzaine d’années. Cet article présente et discute les choix successifs, revers et réussites qui ont permis d’aboutir à un produit stable, didactique et correct sur le plan scientifique. La présentation du contexte historique permet de justifier l’effort initial. On montre ensuite combien il est important que le chercheur ne se laisse pas supplanter par l’ingénierie. La présentation succincte des fonctionnalités proposées par ces trois logiciels gratuits débouche sur l’appréciation d’avantages comparatifs avec des produits payants. Le quatrième chapitre explicite et justifie les choix techniques : systèmes d’exploitation, interface utilisateur, format des fonds de cartes, sélection des méthodes de traitement statistique (analyse multivariée et analyse exploratoire). Vient alors la question de la diffusion des programmes : mode de diffusion (sur internet) et public effectif (dans l’enseignement supérieur, la recherche et d’autres milieux professionnels). Enfin, une série de recommandations portent sur différents aspects du développement des logiciels scientifiques : code source, documentation, amélioration de la culture informatique des géographes, évaluation scientifique, financement et promotion.},

@ARTICLE{Fogel2000,
  ABSTRACT  = {Taking a page from Darwin's 'On the origin of the species', computer scientists have found ways to evolve solutions to complex problems. Harnessing the evolutionary process within a computer provides a means for addressing complex engineering problems-ones involving chaotic disturbances, randomness, and complex nonlinear dynamics-that traditional algorithms have been unable to conquer. Indeed, the field of evolutionary computation is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science and engineering for just this reason; it is addressing many problems that were previously beyond reach, such as rapid design of medicines, flexible solutions to supply-chain management problems, and rapid analysis of battlefield tactics for defense. Potentially, the field may fulfil the dream of artificial intelligence: a computer that can learn on its own and become an expert in any chosen area},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract. We identify three programming language abstractions for the construction of re-usable components: abstract type members, explicit selftypes and symmetric mixin composition. Together, these abstractions enable us to transform an arbitrary assembly of static program parts with hard references between them into a system of re-usable components. The transformation maintains the structure of the original system. We demonstrate this approach in two case studies, a subject/observer framework and a compiler front-end. 1},

@ARTICLE{Crooks2008,
  ABSTRACT      = {Agent-based modelling (ABM) is becoming the dominant paradigm in social simulation due primarily to a worldview that suggests that complex systems emerge from the bottom-up, are highly decentralised, and are composed of a multitude of heterogeneous objects called agents. These agents act with some purpose and their interaction, usually through time and space, generates emergent order, often at higher levels than those at which such agents operate. ABM however raises as many challenges as it seeks to resolve. It is the purpose of this paper to catalogue these challenges and to illustrate them using three somewhat different agent-based models applied to city systems. The seven challenges we pose involve: the purpose for which the model is built, the extent to which the model is rooted in independent theory, the extent to which the model can be replicated, the ways the model might be verified, calibrated and validated, the way model dynamics are represented in terms of agent interactions, the extent to which the model is operational, and the way the model can be communicated and shared with others. Once catalogued, we then illustrate these challenges with a pedestrian model for emergency evacuation in central London, a hypothetical model of residential segregation model tuned to London data, and an agent-based residential location model, for Greater London. The ambiguities posed by this new style of modelling are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative arbitrariness of such modelling highlighted. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The last is favoured as the basis for causal analysis in sociology. It allows the respective roles of statistics and theory to be clarified and is appropriate to sociology as a largely non-experimental social science in which the concept of action is central.},
